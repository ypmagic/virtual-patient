      "history": "Mr. Farmer reports that his leg has gotten much better since his last visit. He took the antibiotics without any problem and kept his leg elevated and applied hot compresses for several days until it had improved considerably. He has resumed his full work schedule and does not have any difficulty walking or doing his job. His major concern now is that he is behind in his work by several days and doesn't know how he'll catch up. He reports that the farm has not been doing well financially and he is quite despondent about that. He fears that he will have to sell the farm.",
