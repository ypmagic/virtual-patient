      <p><b>Chief Complaint</b>: Redness and swelling on his lower left leg</p>

      <p><b>History of Present Illness</b>: Three days prior to the visit, Mr. Farmer accidentally punctured his lower left leg on a nail protruding from a fence post that he was mending. There was only a minor amount of bleeding. Mr. Farmer did not do anything about it. The next day it was somewhat painful and a little red, but he generally ignored it. Yesterday it was a little worse. Today, the redness and swelling has increased significantly and it feels quite warm to the touch and is somewhat tender. He also finds it uncomfortable to walk. Reports last booster dose of tetanus-diptheria when he served in the Army 15 years ago and has had none since.</p>",

      <p><b>Chief Complaint:</b> Follow up for cellulitis</p>

      <p><b>History of Present Illness</b>: Mr. Farmer reports that his leg has gotten much better since his last visit. He took the antibiotics without any problem and kept his leg elevated and applied hot compresses for several days until it had improved considerably. He has resumed his full work schedule and does not have any difficulty walking or doing his job. His major concern now is that he is behind in his work by several days and doesn't know how he'll catch up. He reports that the farm has not been doing well financially and he is quite despondent about that. He fears that he will have to sell the farm.</p>

      <p><b>Past Medical History</b>: Patient received the usual childhood vaccinations against measles, rubella, mumps, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. He received a booster dose of tetanus-diptheria-acellular pertussis at his last visit. As a child, he remembers having chickenpox, occasional ear infections, but no other serious illnesses. He considers himself to be very healthy. He has had no previous surgery, serious injuries, hospitalizations. He has no known allergies. He is taking no medications at present. He does not smoke tobacco. He drinks one or two pints of ale at the local bar with friends once or twice a week on a regular basis and will have an occasional beer at home infrequently. However, he has not been to the bar in over a month because he \"didn't feel up to it.\" He will have one or two drinks of whiskey only on rare occasions when he is out to eat at a restaurant or at a social event. He eats a well-rounded diet, but hasn't had much of an appetite and has lost some weight. He doesn't do any exercise other than the farm work, which is quite strenuous.</p>

      <p><b>Family History</b>: Mr. Farmer's two parents are both alive and well. His father, age 58, is still an active farmer and has no serious medical problems. His mother, age 56, is also well. His paternal grandmother, age 82, lives in the farmhouse with his parents. He doesn't know her specific medical problems, but says she is frail. Mr. Farmer has two younger brothers and two younger sisters all of whom are well as far as he knows. His 3 children are all in good health.</p>

      <p><b>Personal and Social History</b>: Mr. Farmer grew up on the farm on which he is now living, which is part of what used to be a larger farm owned by his father and his uncle. He is the only one of his siblings and cousins to go into farming. His uncle retired from farming and his father continues to farm the other 50 acres. His wife, age 30, helps out with the farming and raising their 3 children, age 4, 7, and 10. He describes his financial situation as "not good." He has health insurance through a farmers' cooperative. He has a life insurance policy and says that he sometimes thinks his family would be better off if he were dead and they collected on the insurance and sold the farm.</p>

      <p><b>Review of Systems</b></p>

      <p><b>General</b>: Patient says that this latest episode with his leg is just the latest of a series of setbacks. He's very worried about his farm's financial solvency, which is constantly on his mind. He says that he's worrying himself sick: his appetite has been poor and he thinks he's lost weight in the last few months.</p>

      <p><b>Skin</b>: The puncture wound and cellulitis have nearly completely healed. He has had no rashes, sores, itching. Denies any itching, dryness, excessive sweatiness, change in skin color, hair, or nails.</p>

      <p><b>Psychiatric</b>: As noted above, patient is very despondent over the farm situation. He says that he can't see any way out of things and feels quite helpless to turn things around. He feels like a personal failure and feels he has let down his father, especially, not being able to be successful as a farmer. He says that his sleep has been very poor for the last few months. He finds himself awakening at 3 or 4 in the morning and not being able to get back to sleep. He'll get up and start some of the farm work early just to stop thinking about the problems. His appetite has also been poor. His relationship with his wife has deteriorated and he feels that he has been a failure as a husband as well. They have not had sexual relations in more than a month. He thinks his family would be better off if he were dead. He has thought about suicide, but hasn't developed a specific plan or timetable. He denies any hallucinations. He denies any having any previous episodes of feeling so depressed, but says that's because the financial situation has never been so bleak.</p>
